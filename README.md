# Certificate Search Program

## Overview

The Certificate Search Program provides users with a search interface for computer science-related certifications. Users can find suitable certificates from the `Certification_Data.xlsx` database by applying four different search parameters.

### Features

- **Industry Selection**: Choose a specific industry within Computer Science (e.g., Cybersecurity).
- **Organization Selection**: Select the certification provider (e.g., Microsoft) or opt for "Any" organization.
- **Cost Filter**: Set a maximum cost for the certification, with options to select from a dropdown or enter a custom value.
- **Location Preference**: Choose between online, in-person, or either option for certificate delivery.

After entering the search parameters, users can click the search button to view the matching certificates, including their names, costs, locations, and registration links. If no matches are found, users can reset and modify their search criteria.

## Code Snippet

Here's a brief code snippet illustrating the search functionality:

```python
def searchCertificate(selection):
    # Converts cost keywords (from combobox dropdown) to numerical values
    if selection[2] == "Free":
        selection[2] = "0"
    if selection[2] == "Any":
        selection[2] = "2000"

    try:
        selection[2] = float(selection[2])
    except:
        searchOutput("Error")
        return

    matched = []
    # Matching logic here...
```
